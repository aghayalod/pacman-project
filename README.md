# Pacman Project
This project explores various models across artificial intelligence and applying them using various forms of PacMan to judge their performance.

Code base: UC Berkeley - Reinforcement learning project

Reinforcement Learning
This project will implement value iteration and Q-learning. It will first test agents on Gridworld (from class), then apply them to a simulated robot controller (Crawler) and Pacman.
